		<h1>What Is Covid-19 ?</h1>
		<p>
			Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly
			discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will
			experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
			requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying
			medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
			respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
			illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well
			informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it
			spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands
			or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. The
			COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge
			from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important
			that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing
			into a flexed elbow).
