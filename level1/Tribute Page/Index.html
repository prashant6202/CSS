    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 - October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, industrial designer,
        business magnate, media proprietor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and
        majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its
        acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal
        computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple
        co-founder Steve Wozniak.

        Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after
        his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through
        India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to
        sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production
        and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the
        commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI).
        This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in
        1984,the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985
        with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.
